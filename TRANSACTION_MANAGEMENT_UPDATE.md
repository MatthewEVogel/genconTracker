# Transaction Management Update

## Overview
This update adds comprehensive admin functionality to track and manage user transactions, with the ability to sort by date added to the database and improved navigation.

## New Features

### 1. Admin Transaction Tracking

- **Event Details**: Shows event titles, IDs, recipients, and purchasers
- **Transaction Statistics**: Summary of total transactions, purchases, refunds, and active users

### 2. Date-Based Sorting
- **Date Added Column**: New column showing when each transaction was added to the database
- **Automatic Sorting**: Transactions are sorted by creation date (newest first)
- **Preserved Data**: All existing transactions have been timestamped with the migration date

### 3. Transaction Removal
- **Delete Purchases**: Remove individual purchase records
- **Delete Refunds**: Remove individual refund records
- **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting a purchase automatically removes associated refunds

### 4. Improved Navigation
