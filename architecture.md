# React + TypeScript
**What it does**: Core framework for building the UI
**Why it’s good**:
- Component-based design
- Huge ecosystem
- Type safety with TypeScript reduces bugs and improves code clarity

**Alternatives**:
- Vue: Simpler syntax, faster to learn, but less common in large projects
- Svelte: Very lightweight and reactive, but smaller ecosystem
- Plain JS/HTML: Easy to start, but not scalable

**For this project**:
React is by far the most versitile and well supported front end framework. The alternatives are only better under very specific scenarios, none of which are present here.

# Tailwind CSS
**What it does**: Utility-first styling system
**Why it’s good**:
- Rapid styling directly in JSX
- Built-in dark mode, responsive utilities, and accessibility features
- Encourages design consistency

**Alternatives**:
- CSS Modules / SCSS: Traditional, more verbose, slower to iterate
- Bootstrap: Good for quick mockups, but harder to customize
- Styled Components: Works well with JS, but adds runtime overhead

**For this project**:
the ease of use and consistency offered by tailwind makes it better than the alternatives.

# Zustand
***What it does***: Lightweight state management
***Why it’s good***:
- Simple syntax and low boilerplate
- Excellent performance (fine-grained subscriptions)
- Works well with LocalStorage and React

**Alternatives**:
- Redux Toolkit: Great for large teams/apps, but more complex
- Recoil: Better for complex relationships, less mature
- Context API: Good for light state, but inefficient for frequent updates
- Why Zustand: Easy to integrate, no setup overhead, perfect for your personal/team project.

**For this project**:
the simplicity of Zustand makes it the best in this case. It is a small project, and doesn't need the extra power of something like Redux.
