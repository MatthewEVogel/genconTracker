# React + TypeScript
**What it does**: Core framework for building the UI
**Why it’s good**:
- Component-based design
- Huge ecosystem
- Type safety with TypeScript reduces bugs and improves code clarity

**Alternatives**:
- Vue: Simpler syntax, faster to learn, but less common in large projects
- Svelte: Very lightweight and reactive, but smaller ecosystem
- Plain JS/HTML: Easy to start, but not scalable

**For this project**:
React is by far the most versitile and well supported front end framework. The alternatives are only better under very specific scenarios, none of which are present here.

# Tailwind CSS
**What it does**: Utility-first styling system
**Why it’s good**:
- Rapid styling directly in JSX
- Built-in dark mode, responsive utilities, and accessibility features
- Encourages design consistency
**Alternatives**:
- CSS Modules / SCSS: Traditional, more verbose, slower to iterate
- Bootstrap: Good for quick mockups, but harder to customize
- Styled Components: Works well with JS, but adds runtime overhead

**For this project**:
the ease of use and consistency offered by tailwind makes it better than the alternatives.
