# React + TypeScript
**What it does**: Core framework for building the UI
**Why itâ€™s good**:
- Component-based design
- Huge ecosystem
- Type safety with TypeScript reduces bugs and improves code clarity

**Alternatives**:
- Vue: Simpler syntax, faster to learn, but less common in large projects
- Svelte: Very lightweight and reactive, but smaller ecosystem
- Plain JS/HTML: Easy to start, but not scalable

**For this project**
