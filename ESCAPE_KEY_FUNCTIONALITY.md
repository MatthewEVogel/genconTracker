# Escape Key Functionality Implementation

This document outlines the escape key functionality that has been added to all alerts and dialogue boxes in the GenCon Tracker application.

## Overview

The escape key (ESC) can now be used to exit out of all alerts and dialogue boxes throughout the application, providing a better user experience and keyboard accessibility.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Custom Modal Components

#### CanceledEventAlert Component
- **Location**: `components/CanceledEventAlert.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Press ESC to dismiss the canceled event alert
- **Behavior**: Same as clicking "I Understand" button

#### Conflict Modal (Events Page)
- **Location**: `pages/events.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Press ESC to cancel adding an event when conflicts are detected
- **Behavior**: Same as clicking "Cancel" button - removes the event from schedule

### 2. Custom Alert System

#### useCustomAlerts Hook
- **Location**: `hooks/useCustomAlerts.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Replaces browser native `alert()` and `confirm()` functions
- **Features**:
  - Custom styled modals that match the application design
  - Escape key support for all alert types
  - Promise-based API for easy integration
  - Automatic focus management

#### Alert Types Supported:
- **Custom Alert**: Press ESC to dismiss (same as clicking "OK")
- **Custom Confirm**: Press ESC to cancel (same as clicking "Cancel")

### 3. Pages Updated

#### Admin Page (`pages/admin.tsx`)
- Replaced all `alert()` calls with `customAlert()`
- Replaced all `confirm()` calls with `customConfirm()`
- Added escape key support for:
  - User deletion confirmations
  - Event update confirmations
  - Ticket clearing confirmations
  - Success/error notifications

#### Events Page (`pages/events.tsx`)
- Replaced all `alert()` calls with `customAlert()`
- Added escape key support for:
  - Event addition success messages
  - Event removal success messages
  - Error messages
  - Conflict detection modal

#### Transactions Page (`pages/transactions.tsx`)
- Replaced `alert()` call with `customAlert()`
- Added escape key support for:
  - Missing data validation message

## Usage Examples

### For Developers

#### Using Custom Alerts
```typescript
import { useCustomAlerts } from "@/hooks/useCustomAlerts";

function MyComponent() {
  const { customAlert, customConfirm, AlertComponent } = useCustomAlerts();

  const handleAction = async () => {
    // Show alert
    await customAlert('Operation completed successfully!', 'Success');
    
    // Show confirmation
    const confirmed = await customConfirm('Are you sure you want to delete this item?', 'Confirm Delete');
    if (confirmed) {
      // User clicked "Confirm" or pressed Enter
      deleteItem();
    }
    // User clicked "Cancel" or pressed Escape - no action needed
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component content */}
      <button onClick={handleAction}>Perform Action</button>
      
      {/* Required: Add the AlertComponent at the end */}
      <AlertComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Adding Escape Key to Custom Modals
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleEscapeKey = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (event.key === 'Escape' && modalIsOpen) {
      closeModal();
    }
  };

  if (modalIsOpen) {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleEscapeKey);
    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleEscapeKey);
    };
  }
}, [modalIsOpen]);
```

## User Experience

### For End Users

1. **Canceled Event Alerts**: When you see a notification about canceled events, press ESC to dismiss it quickly.

2. **Conflict Warnings**: When adding an event that conflicts with your schedule, press ESC to cancel the addition.

3. **Confirmation Dialogs**: When asked to confirm dangerous actions (like deleting users or clearing tickets), press ESC to cancel safely.

4. **Success/Error Messages**: Press ESC to quickly dismiss any success or error notifications.

## Technical Implementation

### Event Listener Management
- Event listeners are properly added and removed to prevent memory leaks
- Listeners are only active when modals are visible
- Each modal manages its own escape key behavior independently

### Accessibility
- Maintains keyboard navigation standards
- Provides consistent behavior across all dialogue types
- Preserves existing click-based interactions

### Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers
- Gracefully handles keyboard events
- No impact on mobile touch interactions

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Faster interaction with dialogue boxes
2. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Better support for keyboard-only users
3. **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all alerts and modals
4. **Modern UX Standards**: Follows common web application patterns
5. **Reduced Clicks**: Less mouse interaction required

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Enter key support for confirmation dialogs
- Arrow key navigation for multi-button dialogs
- Focus trapping within modals
- Screen reader announcements
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
